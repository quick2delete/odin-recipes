    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups flour</li>
      <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 (1 ounce) bottle McCormick® Red Food Color</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons McCormick® Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups
        with paper liners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium
        speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a
        time. Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla. Gradually beat
        in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not overbeat. Spoon
        batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake
        comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5
        minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter,
        sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
        Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
    </ol>
