    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Bulgogi, sometimes known as Korean BBQ beef, is a dish of thinly sliced
      grilled steak that has been marinated in a sweet soy, sesame, and garlic
      sauce. If you want to spice it up, serve the beef in lettuce cups with
      rice and hot pepper paste (gochujang).
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Steak</li>
      <li>Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Green Onion and Garlic</li>
      <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
      <li>Sesame Oil</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the flank steak in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the
        rest of the ingredients and whisk until blended. Pour the marinade over
        the steak â€” make sure the meat is completely covered. Cover the bowl and
        allow the beef to marinate in the fridge for about an hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly oiled grill set to high heat, cook the beef until it's
        charred and completely cooked through. This should take about 1 or 2
        minutes on each side.
