      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        Bulgogi, sometimes known as Korean BBQ beef, is a dish of thinly sliced
        grilled steak that has been marinated in a sweet soy, sesame, and garlic
        sauce. If you want to spice it up, serve the beef in lettuce cups with
        rice and hot pepper paste (gochujang).

        <li>
          Place the flank steak in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, combine
          the rest of the ingredients and whisk until blended. Pour the marinade
          over the steak â€” make sure the meat is completely covered. Cover the
          bowl and allow the beef to marinate in the fridge for about an hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a lightly oiled grill set to high heat, cook the beef until it's
          charred and completely cooked through. This should take about 1 or 2
          minutes on each side.
        </li>
